1.5.1.0 - February 28 2012
-Added a config file; currently it only has log level in it, but there is room for more (number of executors, etc).

1.5.0.1 - February 22 2011
-Fixed bug in Galleria height, where part of the (portrait orientation) image would be obscured.

1.5.0.0 - February 8 2011
-Complete revamp of the virtual galleries.  There are now five defined services:
	- Converted JPG (used in all other services; converts a single image into a .jpg with specified size and quality)
	- Index (Shows a Galleria presentation of the gallery; uses a JSP template with 'title', 'headers', 'gallery' request attributes.)
	- RSS Feed (Returns an RSS feed of the current gallery)
	- Zip file (Returns a .zip of all original images if full quality downloads are allowed.)  
	- Single Image (Shows a single image on a web page; uses a JSP template with 'title', 'caption', 'imageSource', 'date' request attributes.  Used as the target for RSS links.)
-Added new 'index' taglib, to create links to galleries.  Given a root gallery (root can be '/'), search for all valid galleries within it, and display links to the index page of each.
-Still includes a gallery taglib, although this is now simplified (only taglib attribute is 'galleryName'; all settings are obtained from the settings.xml index* attributes.)

1.4.2.0 - January 31 2011
-Added support for RSS feeds (configured via settings.xml).  You must have the element <rss> with attributes "size", "quality", and optionally, "title", and "link".  (Size / quality are just like the other size / quality attributes; title provides a human readable title for the RSS feed, and link gives the user a link to your main page.
-Added 'showCaption', 'showDate', and 'showFilename' in addition to existing 'showTitle'.  Together these attributes let you customize the info display for a given gallery.

1.4.1.0 - January 29 2011
-Changed 'random' attribute in gallery tag to 'order'; now instead of true / false, you can have 'random', 'reverse' (sorted desc), and 'sorted' (technically anything other than 'random' or 'reverse' works as sorted).

1.4.0.0 - January 8 2011
-Combined gallery and slideshow into one tag p:gallery.
-Both gallery and slideshow are now handled by a single JS gallery, 'galleria' (http://galleria.aino.se/)
-No more flash!  

1.3.2.2 - June 1 2010
-Added the ability to switch between flash and html gallery / slideshow 

1.3.2.1 - May 30 2010
-Added flash slideshows

1.3.2.0 - May 29 2010
-Added flash galleries using simpleviewer

1.3.1.2 - April 28 2010
-When downloading the .zip of files in the gallery, compress first and put the size in the headers so people know how long it will take.

1.3.1.1 - November 1 2009
-Fixed bug where 'download as .zip' would not include any non-jpg files

1.3.1.0 - October 3 2009
-Completely re-wrote slideshow implementation from scratch; this includes better cross browser compatibility, better performance, and the ability to work with browsers without javascript. 

1.3.0.1 - September 30 2009
-Refactored slideshow, cleaned up code, added loading image  

1.3.0.0 - September 27 2009
-Added slideshow tag, shows images in sequence, fading between each
-Renamed project to 'photos' from 'gallery', as it now has multiple photo / image related tags included.

1.2.1.1 - September 26 2009
-Reverted to using Graphics2D for the scaling; JAI doesn't let you specify bilinear scaling on OpenJDK
-Added on-the-fly generation of full quality .zip 'download all' for galleries.  Insert 'download all' link in Gallery Tag if full quality is enabled. 

1.2.1.0 - September 25 2009
-Removed support for Hazelcast (although still using ExecutorService APIs, so it is trivial to re-implement if desired)
-Integrated image conversion into library, removing dependency on moss-image
-Fixed outstanding bug which resulted in strange translations after rotation (showed up as black borders in some images)

1.2.0.1 - September 23 2009
-Working on additional Hazelcast distribution

1.2.0.0 - September 23 2009
-Added support for remote rendering of images using Hazelcast

1.1.0.0 - September 6 2009
-Renamed packages to ca.digitalcave

1.0.3.1 - August 16 2009
-Fixed a bug where an image would result in a 404 reply if the original image had an underscore in it.
-Fixed a bug where loading and close images would not show 

1.0.3.0 - August 4 2009
-Changed Full Quality download link to return the original image byte stream, and not a rescaled version.  This will allow images downloaded via this method to be easily printed, as all the metadata and image quality is still there.
-Changed tag logic so that Show Title is no longer needed to download high quality image.
-Changed download full quality tag name from "fullQualityTitleLink" to "showFullQualityDownload", since the title being visible is not needed.  
-Changed logic for parsing settings.xml to only allow for full quality downloads if size == 0 and quality == 100
-Changed logic so that Full Quality Download link now returns as application/octet-stream MIME type, so that (most) browsers will not view it, but will instead download to disk.
-Changed logic such that settings.xml is required for any gallery viewing - if this file does not exist, any request to a given gallery will result in a 404 error.
-Changed logic such that you must explicitly allow full quality image viewing in settings.xml, or you cannot download the full quality image.  Use the '<full-quality allowed="true"/>' XML tag to allow this.

1.0.2.0 - July 7 2009
-Added a semaphore (currently hardcoded to 2 permits; will look at changing this to be configurable in the future) to control the limit of how many image conversions can happen at once.

1.0.1.0 - May 22 2009
-Converted to use Moss Common StreamUtil to remove dependency on Apache Commons Net

1.0.0.0 - April 29 2009
-Initial stable version
