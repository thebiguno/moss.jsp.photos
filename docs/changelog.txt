1.2.1.1 - September 26 2009
-Reverted to using Graphics2D for the scaling; JAI doesn't let you specify bilinear scaling on OpenJDK
-Added on-the-fly generation of full quality .zip 'download all' for galleries.  Insert 'download all' link in Gallery Tag if full quality is enabled. 

1.2.1.0 - September 25 2009
-Removed support for Hazelcast (although still using ExecutorService APIs, so it is trivial to re-implement if desired)
-Integrated image conversion into library, removing dependency on moss-image
-Fixed outstanding bug which resulted in strange translations after rotation (showed up as black borders in some images)

1.2.0.1 - September 23 2009
-Working on additional Hazelcast distribution

1.2.0.0 - September 23 2009
-Added support for remote rendering of images using Hazelcast

1.1.0.0 - September 6 2009
-Renamed packages to ca.digitalcave

1.0.3.1 - August 16 2009
-Fixed a bug where an image would result in a 404 reply if the original image had an underscore in it.
-Fixed a bug where loading and close images would not show 

1.0.3.0 - August 4 2009
-Changed Full Quality download link to return the original image byte stream, and not a rescaled version.  This will allow images downloaded via this method to be easily printed, as all the metadata and image quality is still there.
-Changed tag logic so that Show Title is no longer needed to download high quality image.
-Changed download full quality tag name from "fullQualityTitleLink" to "showFullQualityDownload", since the title being visible is not needed.  
-Changed logic for parsing settings.xml to only allow for full quality downloads if size == 0 and quality == 100
-Changed logic so that Full Quality Download link now returns as application/octet-stream MIME type, so that (most) browsers will not view it, but will instead download to disk.
-Changed logic such that settings.xml is required for any gallery viewing - if this file does not exist, any request to a given gallery will result in a 404 error.
-Changed logic such that you must explicitly allow full quality image viewing in settings.xml, or you cannot download the full quality image.  Use the '<full-quality allowed="true"/>' XML tag to allow this.

1.0.2.0 - July 7 2009
-Added a semaphore (currently hardcoded to 2 permits; will look at changing this to be configurable in the future) to control the limit of how many image conversions can happen at once.

1.0.1.0 - May 22 2009
-Converted to use Moss Common StreamUtil to remove dependency on Apache Commons Net

1.0.0.0 - April 29 2009
-Initial stable version
