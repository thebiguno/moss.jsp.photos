1.0.3.0 - August 4 2009
-Changed Full Quality download link to return the original image byte stream, and not a rescaled version.  This will allow images downloaded via this method to be easily printed, as all the metadata and image quality is still there.

-Modified logic for parsing settings.xml to only allow for full quality downloads if size == 0 and quality == 100
